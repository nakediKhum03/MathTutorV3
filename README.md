## Summary
This is a simple math tutor that gives the user two random numbers and one random math
symbol and uses those to make a equation to solve. the two random numbers are 1 to 10
both inclusive, and the four math symbols are +, -, *, and /. And it can also tell the
user if they are correct or incorrect. and lets you continue on to more questions if they
want. It gives the user three attempts to fix their mistake if wrong. And adds a leveling 
system to the code so that if you get three correct in a row then it levels you up, vise 
versa if you get three incorrect in a row.

## Console Output Example
```
IF CORRECT * 3 & INCORRECT * 3
